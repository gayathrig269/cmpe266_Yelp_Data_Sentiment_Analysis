How Sentiment Analysis can help your business ?

For example, the Pai Northern Thai Kitchen, the complaints were about Service. Now when we go deeper into the Service complaints, we can find out various aspects of the service complaints such as

    why our waitress seemed to be in such a hurry to get us out of the place.

    This restaurant was crowded and noisy. The tables were packed so closely that I was falling over other diners while maneuvering to my seat

    but their service was God-awful. They rarely attended our table, It took 55 minutes for our food to arrive. They took our drink orders and did not deliver them

Another interesting complaint for the Chipotle Business in Yonge Street Toronto was that they did not accept Interac , a standard payment method in Canada

Examples involving it are as follows

    Not complying with customers' choice to pay with Interac, a standard payment method in Canada, is also a nuisance

    Only reason it got a 4 star is because they don't accept interac which is my go to.
